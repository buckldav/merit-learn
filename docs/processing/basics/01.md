# What is a Programming Language?

**Programming Languages** are human-readable languages that can easily be translated into binary (computer-readable language; 0s and 1s). Here are a few characteristics of programming languages:

- Non-ambiguous. Every keyword in a programming language matches specifically to exactly one string of binary digits. There are no double meanings.
- Four functions of a computer: Input, Output, Storage, and Processing are all capabilities of a programming language.

## Pick a Language

Why are there different programming languages? Which one should I choose?

Like the codecademy video above mentioned, each programming language can be thought of as a different tool (hammer, saw, etc.). Some tools are better at certain tasks than others. Here is a table of a few programming languages and what they are primarily used for.

| Language   | Popular Uses                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript | Web and Mobile Apps                                      |
| Python     | Web Servers and Data Science                             |
| Java       | Enterprise Software and Android Apps                     |
| C          | Operating and Embedded Systems                           |
| C++        | Enterprise Software and Game Programming (Unreal Engine) |
| C#         | Windows Apps and Game Programming (Unity Engine)         |
| Swift      | MacOS and iOS Apps                                       |
| SQL        | Databases                                                |

## Getting Started

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are text editors that can run your programs. We recommend [Replit](https://replit.com) for an online IDE and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a more robust offline editor.

Examples in this and other tutorials on this site will be accessible on [Replit](https://replit.com). It is easy to get started with [most languages](https://replit.com/templates) on Replit and we recommend it as you are trying out a language for the first time. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is among the [top editors](https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html) for professional and amateur developers alike and has many tools that can enhance the development experience. As you build larger projects, VS Code will likely be the way to go.
