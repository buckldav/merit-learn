# Snowflake App

We're going to use for loops to draw some patterns. Fork this replit project to begin: [https://replit.com/@buckldav/SnowflakeStarter#script.js](https://replit.com/@buckldav/SnowflakeStarter#script.js).

The two functions that we will be modifying are:

```javascript
function snowflake(x, y, radius, branches) {
  // TODO
}

function drawSnowflakes() {
  // TODO
}
```

## Loop the Branches

Here is code to draw a single branch of a snowflake.

```javascript
function snowflake(x, y, radius, branches) {
  branch(x, y, radius, branches)
}

function drawSnowflakes() {
  fill("cyan")
  stroke("blue")
  strokeWeight(5)
  snowflake(150, 150, 60, 6)
}
```

We need to modify `snowflake()` to call `branch()` `branches` times. To repeat the call of `branch()`, we can use a for loop.

### For Loop

A **for loop** repeats a certain number of times. It is made of 4 parts:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // body
}
```

* The `initialization` is where we declare a variable `i` to count up as we loop. `let i = 0;`
* The `condition` specifies when we stop the loop. `i < 3;`
* The `increment` specifies how much to increase `i` by each time through the loop. `i++`

```javascript
// i++ means increment or increase i by 1 each time
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
```

There is no 3 printed because once `i = 3`, the condition becomes false (`3 < 3`) and the loop stops.

### Snowflake For Loop

Here's how we could apply a for loop to `snowflake()` to draw a branch `branches` amount of times. 

```javascript
function snowflake(x, y, radius, branches) {
  for (let i = 0; i < branches; i++) {
    branch(x, y, radius, branches)
  }
}
```

## Add Some Randomness

When we call `snowflake()` in `drawSnowflake()`, we could use [p5's random function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) to randomize each parameter.

```javascript
function drawSnowflakes() {
  fill("cyan")
  stroke("blue")
  strokeWeight(5)
  snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), random(4, 6))
}
```

### Floating Point vs. Integer Numbers

You'll notice that your snowflake probably looks a little off. This is because `random()` produces a **floating-point** (decimal) number instead of an **integer** (whole number). This only affects us significantly for the branches parameter. To convert that floating-point number to the nearest integer, we can use p5's `int()` function.

```javascript
// Cast the branches random number to an int
snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), int(random(4, 6)))
```

## Draw Lots of Snowflakes

You can copy and paste your snowflake function calls like so...

```javascript
function drawSnowflakes() {
  fill("cyan")
  stroke("blue")
  strokeWeight(5)
  snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), int(random(4, 6)))
  snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), int(random(4, 6)))
  snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), int(random(4, 6)))
}
```

But now we have loops so there's a better way! Remove the copy and pasted function calls and replace them with a for loop. Try it on your own, and if you can't figure it out, check the answer.

  <summary>Answer</summary>

The number in the for loop condition determines how many times the loop runs.

```javascript
function drawSnowflakes() {
  fill("cyan")
  stroke("blue")
  strokeWeight(5)

  // draw 3 snowflakes
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    snowflake(random(100, 400), random(100, 400), random(40, 80), int(random(4, 6)))
  }
}
```
