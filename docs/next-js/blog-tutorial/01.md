# Next.js Blog Tutorial - Part 1

Set up a Next.js project and learn the basics.

## What is Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a [React](https://reactjs.org) Framework that provides a positive and guided frontend developer experience. It (along with other React apps) uses `jsx` to combine JavaScript and HTML together into single files, allowing you to easily reuse code and components (like navigation) across your site. Other cool features include:

- Prefetching pages for faster load times.
- Server-side rendering for better search engine optimization (SEO).
- File/folder-based routing to make page creation and navigation easy to set up.

## Project Scope and Structure

In this series of tutorials, we will take the [replit](https://replit.com) Next.js template and make a simple blog. The goal of this project will be to learn to create reusable components and take advantage of Next's SEO tools.

## Creating a Project

Visit [https://replit.com](https://replit.com). Create an account if you haven't already. Then, click the blue Create Repl button and select the Next.js Template.

When your project is generated, the folder structure will look like this:

![Folders Bad](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/02-project-files.PNG)

```
pages/
  api/
  public/
styles/
```

### Get to Know the Project Folders

#### `public` folder

The `public` folder needs to moved to the root of the project (same level as `pages` and `styles`). Click and drag the folder to do so. This folder contains static files that need to be served (like the favicon, which can be accessed from `/favicon.ico`).

![Folders Good](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/02-1-project-files-fix-public.PNG).

```
pages/
  api/
public/
styles/
```

#### `pages` and `styles` folders

The other folders are pretty self explanatory. `pages/` contains each page of your site (one `.js` file per page). `styles/` contains your CSS files.

We won't be bothering with the `.next/` and `pages/api/` folders in this project. Just know that the `.next/` folder contains the built version of our project.

## Pages

### Modifying `index.js`

In Next.js, each page gets its own file. `index.js` is the page that is loaded when the site is visited with no path in the URL.

Open `index.js` and modify it to only contain the following (you can replace everything with this):

```jsx
import Head from "next/head"
import Image from "next/image"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Head>
        <title>My Next App | Home</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <h1>Home</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

On line 4, you'll see `export default function Home() {`. In React apps, a JavaScript function can be used to make a **component**. Components can contain logic (written in JavaScript) and return the HTML to be rendered to the screen. Components' functions are named with `PascalCase` (in this case `Home`).

You may have noticed the `<Head>` component. We can put our metadata in here and those tags will be put in the `<head>` of the HTML document that is generated when we visit this page.

Note that components can only return one HTML element (in this case, `<main>`). The rest must be children of that element.

### Create `about.js`

Duplicate the `index.js` file and call the new file `about.js`. Make sure the files are at the same directory level. In `about.js`, change every instance of "Home" to "About".

### Routing

In Next.js, the file names determine the URL paths (known as routes). That means that files in the `pages/` directory should follow the `kebab-case` naming convention.

Here's what the pages we've made look like in the browser. Notice that `about.js` is accessed from the path `/about` in the URL.

![About Page](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/05-about-page.PNG)

## App-Wide Layout - Creating a Navigation Component

Let's add a navigation bar at the top of each page. We could go to `index.js`, make our navigation bar, and copy it to `about.js`, but there is a better way. We will instead create a single "Nav" component that can be reused on each page.

### Creating Files and Folders

At the root of our directory, add a `components/` folder. Within that folder, create a file called `Nav.js`. In the `styles/` folder, match that structure by creating a `components/` folder and a `Nav.module.css` file within that folder. The structure should look like this:

![Navigation Folders](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/06-nav-dirs.PNG)

```
components/
  Nav.js
pages/
public/
styles/
  components/
    Nav.module.css
  globals.css
  Home.module.css
```

### `components/Nav.js`

Open `components/Nav.js` and add the following. Next.js uses its own special `<Link>` component instead of `<a>` tags for relative links (links within the site, see [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) for more).

```jsx
import Link from "next/link"
import styles from "../styles/components/Nav.module.css"

export default function Nav() {
  return (
    <nav className={styles.nav}>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

Also, notice the `../` in the line where styles are being imported. This means go up a folder (not just here, but in any file path in any program).

### CSS Modules

CSS modules allow you to add component-specific CSS Classes. Let's create a `.nav` class and add some basic styles to our `styles/components/Nav.module.css` file:

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.nav a {
  display: inline-block;
  color: #0070f3;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

The CSS module can be imported as a JavaScript object and the class can be accessed with the `.` operator.

```jsx
// In components/Nav.js
import styles from "../styles/components/Nav.module.css"
...
<nav className={styles.nav}>
```

### \_app.js

So far, we have ignored `_app.js`. All we need to know at this point is that this is the file that loads the current page as its `Component`. We can add our `Nav` component here to ensure that it appears on every page at the top.

```jsx
import Nav from "../components/Nav.js"
import "../styles/globals.css"

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Nav />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

You may notice the thing that looks like an empty tag (`<>`). This is a [React Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html), and is used because a `function` can only return a single element. Therefore, a Fragment is used to wrap the components in an "empty element".

## Result

Now, your pages should look like this:

![Home Page Finished](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/07-home-finished.PNG)
![About Page Finished](/assets/images/nextjs/tutorial/01/08-about-finished.PNG)

## Conclusion

Next.js is a great tool to create frontend applications. It allows you to organize your code and reuse layouts across different pages.
