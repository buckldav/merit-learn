# React State and Props

This lesson will show you how to make a React application and manage the app's data.

## Set Up React App

We will making React Apps using [replit's React Templates](https://replit.com/@replit/Reactjs?v=1). For local development, here's a quick guide on [how to create a React app with Vite](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/creating-a-react-app-using-vite/) (the same build tool that replit uses). This is the project's `src` directory, which is the only part of the project that we will concern ourselves with today.

Visit `App.css` and delete everything there so we can add our own markup without it looking odd.

## Editing `App.jsx` and JSX Syntax

When you first open `App.jsx` in your project, you should see this:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import "./App.css"

function App() {
  return <main>React‚öõÔ∏è + Vite‚ö° + ReplitüåÄ</main>
}

export default App
```

### Components

Let's dissect the code. A React **component** is a class or function which renders a single element of HTML (and it's children). Notice how our `App` function returns a `<main>` element. This ability to mix HTML and JavaScript together is thanks to the JSX syntax, unique to React.

## Component State and Props

### State

_[Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)_

A component can store information in its `state`. To "hook" this functionality of storing information into a functional React component, we use the [React Hook `useState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

Consider this example below:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"

function App() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button onClick={(e) => setClicks(clicks + 1)}>Clicks: {clicks}</button>
  )
}
```

<div style="padding-left: 1em">
    <button id="count">Clicks: 0</button>
    <script>
        let count = 0;
        const button = document.querySelector("#count");
        button.addEventListener("click", e => {
            count += 1;
            button.innerHTML = "Clicks: " + count;
        });
    </script>
</div>

This `App` component is keeping track of how many times the button was clicked in the `clicks` state variable. An `onClick` event handler was bound to the button where the `setClicks` method was called, updating `clicks` by adding 1 to the most recent value and setting `clicks` to the result of that addition.

Note that putting `{}` between tags (`<button>Clicks {clicks}</button>`) allows you to render variables as part of an element's content easily.

### Props

_[Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper)_

Component attributes are called `props`. Any component or HTML element can be given props in its opening tag. This includes user-defined components. Consider this example:

```jsx
function HowMany(props) {
  return (
    <p>
      You have {props.quantity} {props.things}.
    </p>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <HowMany things="apples" quantity={3} />
      <HowMany things="bananas" quantity={10} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

<div style="padding-left: 1em">
    <p>You have 3 apples.</p>
    <p>You have 10 bananas.</p>
</div>

In the above example, data was passed from the `App` component to its children `HowMany` components. The props were accessed in the `HowMany` component with the dot operator on the `props` object (`props.quantity`).

### Data Flow with State and Props

_[Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)_

State goes in parent components and get passed as props to children components. If a child needs to modify the state of its parent, you need to pass in a function from parent to child that can accomplish that. We'll dive into this concept more later, but for now, check out this practice task below to see it in action.

## Practice Task: User Profile

Here is an app with a faux user profile interface. You can access and fork the starting code [here](https://replit.com/@buckldav/StateAndProps#src/App.jsx). You will only need to modify `App.jsx`. If you scroll down, you can see the relevant code that you will be extending.

So far, the app keeps track of the user's name. In the return block, notice how there is a `<UserField>` component being used with three props.

```jsx
<UserField field="Name" value={name} editValue={setName} />
```

`name` and `setName` correspond with the state variable declared at the top of the `App` component. When you click the "Edit" button in the UI, the state updates with a new name.

```jsx
function App() {
    const [name, setName] = useState("Your Name Here");

    ...
}
```

### Assignment

1. Add two more state variables under the `name`. **(2 pts)**
   - Make the variables have to do with the user (i.e. username, email, age, favoriteColor, etc.) **(1 pt)**
2. Instantiate two more `<UserField>` components with the state variable being passed in as props (3 props total, `field`, `value`, and `editValue`). **(2 pts)**

### Starting Code

Full code: [https://replit.com/@buckldav/StateAndProps#src/App.jsx](https://replit.com/@buckldav/StateAndProps#src/App.jsx).

```jsx
// App.jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"
import "./App.css"

function UserField(props) {
  function buttonClick() {
    const newValue = window.prompt("New " + props.field)
    props.editValue(newValue)
  }

  return (
    <p>
      {props.field}: {props.value} <button onClick={buttonClick}>Edit</button>
    </p>
  )
}

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Your Name Here")
  // TODO: Add 2 more state variables

  return (
    <main>
      <UserField field="Name" value={name} editValue={setName} />
      {/* TODO: 2 more UserFields */}
    </main>
  )
}

export default App
```
