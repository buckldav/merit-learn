# Better Spirals

Have a go at reading over the code below and guessing what it does. Then run it to see if you were correct.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()
#screen.colormode(255)

R = 255
G = 0
B = 0

screen.bgcolor((255, 255, 255))

for i in range(2000):
    G += 1
    B += 0.5
    R -= 1
    turtle.color((R, G, B))
    turtle.forward(i)
    turtle.right(98)
```

The first thing youâ€™ll probably notice is that this is going to take ages to run. We can speed things up a bit, though. Add in the following line, before the `for` loop:

```python
turtle.speed(0)
```

Run the code again: it should be a little faster.

Our code has made a multicoloured spiral by changing the `R`, `G`, and `B` variables. The colours are a little one-dimensional, though. Can you do a better job?
