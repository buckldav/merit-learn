# Modulo to the Rescue

In the previous example, you need a way to keep looping over the list items, so when `i` gets to 9, it will go back around and get the “0th” item from the list again. This is where the modulo operator `%` can help you out.

Look at the code below: run it and see if you can figure out what is going on. You shoud get `0` to begin with.

```python
print(18 % 6)
```

Try changing the numbers in the print command. There are some examples to try below:

```python
print(17 % 6)
print(12 % 6)
print(13 % 6)
print(6 % 6)
print(0 % 6)
print(1 % 6)
print(8 % 6)
print(11 % 6)
```

Did you figure it out? The `%` operator prints out the remainder of a division. For example, 15 ÷ 6 is 2 with a remainder of 3. Therefore 15 % 6 would be 3. We can use this operator to help with the problem of running off the end of the list. If the `range` goes above the length of the list, you can just do a `%` of the length of the list.

Have a look at the example below, and read through the code carefully to make sure you can see how the modulo operator is used.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

screen.bgcolor((0, 0, 255))

colours = [(28, 138, 126), (46, 120, 108), (143, 13, 132), (200, 18, 85), (78, 224, 239),
        (88, 20, 216), (36, 108, 248), (99, 237, 136), (146, 31, 91), (10, 154, 152),
        (127, 160, 117), (181, 203, 36), (201, 97, 179), (1, 3, 180), (21, 27, 214),
        (26, 94, 11), (161, 246, 62), (224, 51, 159), (51, 62, 148), (115, 224, 188)]

turtle.speed(0)

for i in range(2000):
    # The line below means a colour is always chosen, even if i is
    # larger than the length of ths list
    turtle.color(colours[i % len(colours)])
    turtle.forward(i)
    turtle.right(98)
```
