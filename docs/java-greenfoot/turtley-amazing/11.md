# Putting it All Together

You can now use the `while` loops along with the spiral code to make a really pretty spiral. Have a look at the code below, and make sure you understand what it is doing. Try playing with the value of the variables in the loops, to see what effect this has on the output.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

R = 255
G = 0
B = 0

screen.bgcolor((0, 0, 255))

turtle.speed(0)

colours = []

while G <= 255:
    colours.append((R, G, B))
    G += 1

while R >= 0:
    colours.append((R, G, B))
    R -= 1

while B < 255:
    colours.append((R, G, B))
    B += 1

while G > 0:
    colours.append((R, G, B))
    G -= 1

while R < 255:
    colours.append((R, G, B))
    R += 1


for i in range(3000):
    # The line below keeps changing the colour, even if i
    # is bigger than the list of colours
    turtle.color(colours[i % len(colours)])
    turtle.forward(i/3)
    turtle.right(119)
```
