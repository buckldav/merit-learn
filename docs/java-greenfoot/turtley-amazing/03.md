# Drawing a Line

The image on the previous page is made up of lines and only lines! To get started, you need to know how to draw a line using a little bit of Java code in the Greenfoot environment.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

turtle.forward(100)
```

- Click on Run arrow to see the code working.
- Now try changing the number in the line turtle.forward(100), click on Run arrow again and see what happens.
