# Changing Colors

The default color for the pen used by the turtle cursor is black, and the default background color is white. You can change the colors to make your shapes look even better.

Look at the code below. It contains three variables called `R`, `G`, and `B`.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

R = 255
G = 255
B = 0

screen.bgcolor((R, G, B))
```

Variables are a way of storing a value and giving it a name. For instance, there is a variable name `R` with a value of `255`.

Run the code and see what happens.

Try changing the values of the three variables, and see what happens. (Note: the maximum value is 255, and after this there will be no effect.) What do you think R, G, and B represent?

R, G and B represent how much red, green, and blue will be used in the color. Each can have any value from 0 up to 255.

So to make yellow, you could try the following:

```python
R = 255
G = 255
B = 0
```

When we want to represent a color in a computer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that make up that color. These amounts are usually stored as a single byte and therefore as a number between 0 and 255.

Hereâ€™s a table showing some color values:

```
Red	Green	Blue	Color
255	0	0	Red
0	255	0	Green
0	0	255	Blue
255	255	0	Yellow
255	0	255	Magenta
0	255	255	Cyan
```

You can find a [nice color picker to play with at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp).

You can change the value of your variables either by setting them to a new value, or by increasing and decreasing them.

You can change the colour of the turtle as well. Run the code below to see what happens:

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

R = 255
G = 0
B = 124

turtle.color((R, G, B))
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(120)
turtle.forward(100)
```

## Challenge

Try to complete each of the challenges below.

- Complete the triangle above with a colour of your choice.
- Draw a square with sides which are four different shades of red.
- Draw a cross made of four different colors.

To change a color, you can just keep adding or subtracting values from the original variables.

So you could alter colors by doing the following:

```python
R = 255
G = 0
B = 0

turtle.color((R, G, B))
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(120)

R -= 20
G += 20
B += 5

turtle.color((R, G, B))
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(120)
```
