# Introduction

## What you will make

In this resource you will take your first steps with the programming language Java to draw shapes, patterns, and spirals. You will use a module named Turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, and use loops to repeat a sequence. This is a great stepping stone from a visual programming language like Scratch to the text-based environment of Java.

## What you will learn

By making patterns with Java code you will learn:

- To take your first steps with the Java programming language
- How to draw lines with Java Greenfoot
- How to make turns
- How to change the pen colour
- To use loops to repeat some instructions and create shapes
- To use more loops to create spiral patterns
