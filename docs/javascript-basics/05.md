# Events

Events occur when the page loads, a button is click, a form is submitted, etc. In short, they allow code to be executed when the user or browser performs or completes an action. Here's a short list of common events and when they are triggered.

| Event     | Trigger                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `change`  | When an input, textarea, or select element's data changes. |
| `click`   | When an element is clicked. Usually reserved for buttons.  |
| `keydown` | When a key on the keyboard is pressed.                     |
| `load`    | When an element like a picture loads.                      |
| `submit`  | When form data is submitted.                               |

## Window Events

Events can be triggered by the window. `onload`, `onkeydown`, `onscroll` are common events.

### Example 1: Two Ways to Add an Event

Here are two ways that you could assign a function to the `onload` event of the window. The code below will trigger an alert when the page is loaded.

```javascript
window.onload = function (event) {
  window.alert("The page loaded.")
}

// This code is equivalent to the code above.
// This is the way we will add events in this tutorial.
window.addEventListener("load", function (event) {
  window.alert("The page loaded.")
})
```

### Example 2: Play an audio clip that says "E" when the user types an "E"

```javascript
window.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  // The event object contains information related to the user's action
  if (event.key === "e") {
    const synth = window.speechSynthesis
    const e = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("E")
    e.voice = synth.getVoices()[0]
    synth.speak(e)
  }
})
```

**Try pressing "e" on the keyboard and see what happens! (sound on)**

<script>
window.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  if (event.key === "e") {
    const synth = window.speechSynthesis;
    const e = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("E");
    e.voice = synth.getVoices()[0];
    synth.speak(e);
  }
})
</script>

## Element Events

You can detect when a specific element is having an action done to it. Here are some examples.

### Example 1: Add a CSS class to an image when it loads

Given that a CSS class `.fade-in` will perform a fade animation on an element, fade the image in when the source loads.

```html
<img
  src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg"
  width="300"
  height="300"
/>
<script>
  const img = document.querySelector("img")
  img.addEventListener("load", function (event) {
    img.classList.add("fade-in")
  })
</script>
```

<details markdown="block">
  <summary>Result</summary>

##### HTML

```html
<img
  src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg"
  width="300"
  height="300"
  class="fade-in"
/>
```

##### Rendered Content

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="fade-in">

</details>

### Example 2: Have a button that triggers an alert on click

```html
<button id="alert">Alert!</button>
<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("#alert")
  button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    window.alert("Button!")
  })
</script>
```

<details markdown="block">
  <summary>Result</summary>

##### Rendered Content

<button id="alert" onclick="window.alert('Button!')">Alert!</button>

</details>

## Practice Task: HTML Toggle Button

Make a toggle button that shows and hides HTML content. This is a common functionality needed for mobile navigation drawers. See an example here: https://drawerexample.buckldav.repl.co/.

- The button should handle both actions with a single on click event listener. **(5 pts)**
  - Hint: you will likely need an if/else statement in your listener function.
- The HTML content should show if it's hidden and hide if its shown. **(5 pts)**
