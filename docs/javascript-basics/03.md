# The `document` and `window` Objects

We are to the point where we can use JavaScript for its original purpose &ndash; as a client-side scripting language to interact with HTML.

## PREREQUISITE: Build a multi-page HTML/CSS project

## The Document Object Model (DOM)

An HTML Document is comprised of HTML Elements. An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Frequently, the opening tag will have attributes, which are details that further define the look and behavior of the content.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that contains an HTML document's elements and their relationships. In JavaScript, this interface can be accessed with the built-in `document` object.

Here's an example HTML document and its corresponding DOM.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A heading</h1>
    <a href="/">Link text</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

### DOM Methods

There are methods associated with the `document` object that allow programs to access individual elements and collections of elements from the DOM.

| Property                                 | Description                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `document.getElementById(value)`         | Returns the element of that id.                        |
| `document.getElementsByClassName(value)` | Returns a collection of elements that have that class. |
| `document.getElementsByTagName(value)`   | Returns a collection of elements of that tag.          |

The query selector methods do similar tasks to the above, but leverage CSS selectors to select elements. The method you use to select elements comes down to personal preference. I like to use these `querySelector` methods because of their versatility, so in this series, I will just use `querySelector` for consistency. You should still know the other methods because of their ubiquity.

| Property                              | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `document.querySelector(selector)`    | Returns the first element that matches the selector.              |
| `document.querySelectorAll(selector)` | Returns a collection of all the elements that match the selector. |

```javascript
// Get an element: <tag id="top">content</tag>
// These two lines accomplish the same task
const byId = document.getElementById("top")
const byIdQuery = document.querySelector("#top")

// Get all elements: <tag class="blue">content</tag>
const byClass = document.getElementsByClassName("blue")
const byClassQuery = document.querySelectorAll(".blue")
// Just the first element that matches the selector
const byClassQueryFirst = document.querySelector(".blue")

// Get all elements: <p>content</p>
const byTag = document.getElementsByTagName("p")
const byTagQuery = document.querySelectorAll("p")
// Just the first element that matches the selector
const byTagQueryFirst = document.querySelector("p")
```

### An HTML Element Object

Once you have an element selected and stored in a variable, you can perform operations on it by accessing and modifying its properties.

| Property                            | Description                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `element.getAttribute(name)`        | Get attribute by name.                 |
| `element.innerHTML`                 | Get/set the inner HTML of the element. |
| `element.innerText`                 | Get/set the inner text of the element. |
| `element.setAttribute(name, value)` | Set attribute by name.                 |
| `element.style.property`            | Set inline style.                      |

## The Window Object (Part 1)

The built-in `window` object contains information and actions related to the browser window. Here are some helpful properties, for a full list, click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window).

| Property                   | Description                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `window.close()`           | Closes the current page.                  |
| `window.innerHeight`       | Returns the height of the viewport.       |
| `window.location.href`     | Returns the full URL to the current page. |
| `window.location.reload()` | Refreshes the current page.               |
| `window.scrollTo(x, y)`    | Scroll to a position in the document.     |

Try these window properties out yourself in a project or the developer console.

## Practice Task: Same Navigation

For multi-page projects that have the same navigation component on each page, it's cumbersome to copy and paste the same navigation HTML to each page, let alone try to make a change later if needed. Proper web apps generate the navigation in some way (usually server-side) to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This project will have you generate the navigation for all pages client-side in a `script.js` file.

Create a HTML5 project with the following file structure:

```
index.html
page1.html
page2.html
script.js
```

Each HTML file should have the following for the `<body>`:

```html
<body>
  <nav id="topNav"></nav>
  <p>Here is a link to this page: <a id="permalink"></a></p>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

Here's a example boilerplate for this project: [https://replit.com/@buckldav/NavigationGenerationStarter](https://replit.com/@buckldav/NavigationGenerationStarter).

In `script.js`...

- Select the `#topNav` and using it's `innerHTML` attribute, add a working `<a>` element for each HTML file.
- Select the `#permalink` and set to `href` attribute to link to whatever page it's on (using the `window` object). Also, the `innerText` of the `#permalink` element should be the same as the `href`.
  - For example, on `page1.html`, the site should say (replacing yourdomain.com with whatever your project's domain is) &ndash; **Here is a link to this page: [https://yourdomain.com/page1.html](https://yourdomain.com/page1.html)**.
