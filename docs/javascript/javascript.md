# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

## Why JavaScript?

There is no "best" general-purpose programming language. Each language has a niche. C is used for operating systems. C# is used for games and Windows apps. JavaScript is used for web-based software. On GitHub, the world's largest code repository, JavaScript is the #1 most used language and TypeScript, its cousin, is #5 ([https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2021/3](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2021/3)). You can build apps, games, pretty much anything with JavaScript. While there is no "best" language, JavaScript certainly makes a strong case to be considered.
