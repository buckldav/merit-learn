# JavaScript Basics Unit

This unit was created by David Buckley for his classes at [Merit Academy](https://meritprepacademy.org) (Springville, UT).

Standards used in the scope and sequence are from the [Computer Programming 1 Strands and Standards](https://www.schools.utah.gov/file/730a5598-fa5c-4fca-b1d5-f121055f11df) from the State of Utah. Standards 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 are covered in their entirety.

## Scope and Sequence

### 1. Introduction: Variables and Functions

#### Standards

##### 2.3 - Identify the components of a programming language syntax.

- Understand keywords, identifiers, operators, and operands.
- Understand statements and expressions in a program.
- Understand program components such as functions, methods, or procedures.

##### 3.1 - Employ basic use of elements and data types of a programming language.

- Declare, initialize, and assign values to constants and variables.

##### 3.2 - Employ basic arithmetic expressions.

- Use basic arithmetic operators (modulus, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction).
- Understand order of operation of expressions.

#### Concepts

- Declaring variables in JavaScript with `let` and `const`.
- Declaring and calling functions in JavaScript.
  - Parameters
  - Return values
- Basic math operators in JavaScript.

### 2. Data Types

#### Standards

##### 3.1 - Employ basic use of elements and data types of a programming language.

- Declare and use variable types (primitives, reference, or object).
- Identify proper data types for a specified application (boolean, integer, floatingpoint, strings).

#### Concepts

- `number`, `string`, and `object` data types.
- How to use the `.` operator to access object properties.
- Object terminology: instance, field, method.

### 3. The `document` and `window` Objects

#### Concepts

- The Document Object Model (DOM).
- Using `document.querySelector()` to select elements.
- Using `element.innerHTML`, `element.innerText`, and `element.setAttribute()` to modify elements in the DOM.
- Using the `window` object to get information about the viewport.

#### Quiz 1-3

At this point, I have students do a Kahoot related to the first three projects.

### 4. Logic and Control Flow

#### Standards

##### 3.1 - Employ basic use of elements and data types of a programming language.

- Demonstrate the ability to use input and output commands.

##### 4.1 - Demonstrate the ability to use relational and logical operators in programs.

- Commpare values using relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, ==, &lt;=, &gt;=, etc.)
- Form complex expressions using logical operators.

##### 4.2 - Demonstrate the ability to use decisions in programs.

- Employ simple IF structures.
- Use IF-ELSE and nested IF-ELSE structures.

#### Concepts

- Use `window.alert()` and `window.prompt()` for input/output.
- Use conditional statements and boolean expressions for branching.

### 5. Events

#### Concepts

- Use `element.addEventListener()` to bind functions to events.

### 6. String, Number, and Array Methods

#### Standards

##### 3.2 - Employ basic arithmetic expressions.

- Write expressions that mix floating-point and integer expressions.

#### Concepts

- Use string and number methods to manipulate and format data.
- Use arrays and array methods to manipulate collections from the DOM.

#### Quiz 2

At this point, I have students do a Kahoot related to the first three projects.
