# Project Setup

## Project Needs

Each mobile app project will have these things:

1. A **manifest**, which describes all the components that comprise your app. When the app is installed, the manifest is referenced to ensure that all of the resources are assembled. (`AndroidManifest.xml` for Android Apps, `manifest.json` for PWAs).
2. Pages. In Android Apps, these are called Activities, which are made up of Java and XML files to define the functionality and layout, respectively. In PWAs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to define the content, layout/style, and functionality respectively.

## Android Project Setup

_If you don't have Android Studio yet, click [here](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#2)._

Follow the tutorial at [https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#2](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#2).

## PWA Project Setup

_If you don't have Visual Studio Code yet, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You will also need the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)_

Your web app will need the following files:

```
index.html
logo.png
manifest.json
service-worker.js
```

### Make a logo quickly

For this app, it doesn't matter too much what your logo is, so you could generate one [here](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html). Download the square image, name it `logo.png`, and put it in your project.

#### Written Steps

1: Set up your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>

    <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <script>
      if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js")
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

2: Generate all the neccesary icons for a PWA and list them in your `manifest.json`.

Start with your `manifest.json` like this:

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "short_name": "My App",
  "start_url": "/",
  "icons": [],
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "display": "fullscreen",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}
```

Then, generate the icons from your `logo.png` file. These icons will be stored in an `icons` folder.

```bash
# Run this in your terminal, which you can open in Visual Studio Code with Ctrl+`.
npx pwa-asset-generator logo.png icons
```

Copy the json output at the bottom of your terminal into your `manifest.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "short_name": "My App",
  "start_url": "/",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icons/manifest-icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable any"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/manifest-icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable any"
    }
  ],
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "display": "fullscreen",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}
```

3: Enable caching in your `service-worker.js` file. The `NetworkFirst()` strategy will use a network if available, otherwise it will use the cache. You may reverse this strategy with `CacheFirst()` if your app doesn't change often.

```js
importScripts(
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/6.5.0/workbox-sw.js"
)

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => request.destination === "image",
  new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst()
  // -- or --
  // new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst()
)
```

4: Serve the app from [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (which you can visit in the browser).

```bash
# In the terminal again.
npx serve
```
