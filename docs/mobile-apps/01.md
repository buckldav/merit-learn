# Project Setup

## Project Needs

Each mobile app project will have these things:

1. A **manifest**, which describes all the components that comprise your app. When the app is installed, the manifest is referenced to ensure that all of the resources are assembled. (`AndroidManifest.xml` for Android Apps, `manifest.json` for PWAs).
2. Pages. In Android Apps, these are called Activities, which are made up of Java and XML files to define the functionality and layout, respectively. In PWAs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to define the content, layout/style, and functionality respectively.
