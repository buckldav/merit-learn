# Traverse Through Scenes and Doors

Now that we have two levels, we need to make a way for a player to get from one to the other. In this tutorial, we will create a Door GameObject that, when collided with, will load the next scene.

## Create Door GameObject

In Scene1, Create a Door GameObject in the Hierarchy that has the following properties:

1. A name and tag of "Door"
2. A script called "Door"
3. A Polygon Collider 2D

When you have created it and placed it in your scene, drag the GameObject from the Hierarchy to the prefabs folder.

## Door Script

Open the `Door.cs` script and add the following:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class Door : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other)
    {
        // If the player collided with the door
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player")
        {
            // Load the next scene
            // The buildIndex is from the Build Settings
            int currentScene = SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex;
            int nextScene = currentScene + 1;
            SceneManager.LoadScene(nextScene, LoadSceneMode.Single);
        }
    }
}
```

The `buildIndex` in the code is from the Build Settings (see below, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to open). You can load any scene by index. The `buildIndex` for `Scenes/Scene1` in this case is `0`. So, when the Player collides with a Door, the next Scene in the Build Settings will be loaded.

## Testing

Test out your game. Add multiple scenes. Add collectibles that take away from your score. Keep track of something else in addition to score on the HUD. Get creative!
