# Project Setup and Folders

Now that we are making a slightly larger project than our one-level platformer, we need to enhance the way we approach organizing our assets and writing our code. Create a new 2D Project via Unity Hub and open it in the Unity Editor.

## Visual Studio Code Configuration

In our platformer project, we used Visual Studio Code to write our scripts. This time, we will install some VS Code extensions to enable IntelliSense (code completion) and manage our scripts better.

## Asset Folders

We will want to have a folder structure like this for our project:

![Asset Organization](/assets/images/unity/topdown/01/org-complete.png)

You can create these folders manually or leverage the VS Code tools we just installed:

### 1. Open the C# Project

Right-click in the Assets window and select **Open C# Project**. This will open VS Code.

### 2. VS Code + Unity Tools Extension

In VS Code, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to open the Command Palette. Type in "unity" and select **"Unity Tools: Generate Organizational Folders"**. Select the current workspace when prompted. This will generate these folders with your Assets folder: Audio, Materials, Prefabs, Scripts, and Scenes.
