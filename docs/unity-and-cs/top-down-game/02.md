# Creating a Player and Tilemap

Let's see how well you remember creating GameObjects in a Scene from the Platformer. If you need to review, visit the Platformer's [Creating a Player](/docs/unity-and-cs/platformer-basics/02) and [Creating a Tilemap](/docs/unity-and-cs/platformer-basics/03) tutorials again.

## Tilemap

When creating the tilemap, be sure to add a `Tilemap Collider 2D` and a `Composite Collider 2D`. The Composite Collider will make it so that collision is applied to the tilemap as a whole instead of each tile individually, improving performance.

To ensure that the tilemap remains in place, be sure that you change these properties on the Rigidbody 2D that was added with the Composite Collider.

1. Body Type `Kinematic`
2. Collision Detection `Continuous`.

## Player

Add a Player GameObject to the Scene. I used a Circle for mine with a `Circle Collider 2D` and `Rigidbody 2D`. Be sure to tag the Player as a `Player` tag and to add the Main Camera as a child of the player.

## Top-Down Player Controller Script

### `Update()` vs. `FixedUpdate()`

This time (as opposed to our script in our platformer), we won't be moving by adding forces to the Player's Rigidbody in `FixedUpdate()`. Instead, we will directly mutate the position of the `transform` component, which can be done in `Update()`. Rigidbody code MUST go in `FixedUpdate()` while everything else can go in `Update()`.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const int SPEED_UNIT = 1000;
    public float speed;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // +1 for right/up, -1 for left/down.
        // Example: Vector2(1, -1) = diagonal direction right and down.
        Vector2 direction = new Vector2(
            Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"),
            Input.GetAxis("Vertical")
        ).normalized;

        // Take the previous position and add any change to it
        // in the x and y directions.
        transform.position = new Vector2(
            transform.position.x + speed * direction.x / SPEED_UNIT,
            transform.position.y + speed * direction.y / SPEED_UNIT
        );
    }
}
```

We have are dividing by `SPEED_UNIT` because if we moved by `speed` every frame (60x a second), we would go too far too quickly.

### Set `speed` in the Inspector

I set my `Speed` to be `20` as well as the `Gravity Scale` of the Rigidbody to be `0` (because we do not have gravity in this game). Also, I set the collision of the Rigidbody to be `Continuous`.

Draw some tiles and test out your game's movement.
