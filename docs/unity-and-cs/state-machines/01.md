# Getting Started

## Set up Git repository and clone project

Once logged in to [GitHub](https://github.com), go to the repository at [https://github.com/buckldav/unity-state-machine](https://github.com/buckldav/unity-state-machine). Click on the "Use this template" â†’ "Create a new repository".

Then, name your repository and click "Create repository from template".

Finally, clone the repository with your preferred method. We recommend using either:

1. `git clone` in a [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) terminal or
2. "Open with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)"

## Open project

Go to Unity Hub and click "Open" to open the cloned project. Then, navigate in your filesystem to the **folder** where the project is located (in the picture below, the folder name is _unity-state-machine-finished_), select the folder, and click "Open".

Open `Scenes/SampleScene` to ssee the game scene.

## Explore files and GameObjects

The following features are already implemented:

- A Player GameObject with these states: `Falling`, `Moving`, and `Jumping`. Arrow keys enable movement (Left, Right, and Up).
- Two Tilemaps, one for Ground (enables the `Jumping` state) and one for Walls (cannot be jumped off of).
- A Enemy. When the Player collides with an Enemy, the Player respawns.

### The Player Controller and State Machine

In `Scripts/PlayerController.cs`, there is an `enum` that contains 3 different player states. The player starts in the falling state.

```cs
enum PlayerState {
    Moving,
    Jumping,
    Falling,
}

private PlayerState currentState = PlayerState.Falling;
```

Here is a diagram that outlines the possible transitions between states.

Take some time to read through the code and play the game to see when the states change.
