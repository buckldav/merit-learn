# Scripting: Finishing our Platformer

Let's add some code to control our player. Select the Player from the Hierarchy and Add a Script Component called "PlayerController".

![Create Script](/assets/images/unity/platformer/05/script-create.png)

![Create Script 2](/assets/images/unity/platformer/05/script-create-2.png)

The script will be placed in the Assets folder. Double-click on it to open it in your C# code editor.

## Default Script

### Start() and Update()

For code that you want to run once, put it in the `Start()` method. For code that you want to run every frame (like animations), put it in the `Update()` frame.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

    }
}
```

## Variables and FixedUpdate

We will need some variables to reference the data that we will be using. For example, the `Rigidbody2D rb` will be a reference to the Rigidbody2D attached to our Player. Variables should be `private` unless you want to be able to set them in the Unity Inspector later.

Additionally, we will replace `void Update()` with `void FixedUpdate()`, which gets called every frame like `Update()` but is used for physics.

```csharp
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool isGrounded;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;

    // Public variables are set in the Unity Inspector
    public float xSpeed;
    public float jumpStrength;

    // Initialize all private variables in Start
    void Start()
    {
        isGrounded = false;
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    // FixedUpdate is used for physics (Rigidbody2D)
    void FixedUpdate()
    {

    }
}
```

### Add horizontal movement

Here's the code for horizontal movement. I'll walk through it step by step below.

```csharp
void FixedUpdate()
{
    float xHat = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0).normalized.x;
    float vx = xHat * xSpeed;
    rb.AddForce(transform.right * vx);
}
```

---

```csharp
float xHat = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0).normalized.x;
```

- `float` is a data type for decimals.
- `Vector2` is a object that can store an `x` and `y` value. `new` creates that object.
- `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")` gets the input from the keyboard (Left/Right Arrows, A/D by default).
- `.normalized.x` makes it so that we get `1` for pushing left (positive x) and `-1` for pushing right (negative x).

---

```csharp
float vx = xHat * xSpeed;
rb.AddForce(transform.right * vx);
```

Because `xHat` is just a positive or negative 1, multiplying it by `xSpeed` will create a value for the velocity `vx` that sends the player left or right when added as a force to the Rigidbody.

### Add vertical movement

```csharp
void FixedUpdate()
{
    float xHat = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0).normalized.x;
    float vx = xHat * xSpeed;
    rb.AddForce(transform.right * vx);

    float yHat = new Vector2(0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical")).normalized.y;
    if (isGrounded && yHat == 1) {
        float vy = yHat * jumpStrength;
        isGrounded = false;
        rb.AddForce(transform.up * vy);
    }
}

void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
{
    // You can get rid of the Debug.Log when you want
    Debug.Log(collision.gameObject.tag);
    isGrounded = collision.gameObject.tag == "Ground";
}
```

---

```csharp
if (isGrounded && yHat == 1) {
    float vy = yHat * jumpStrength;
    isGrounded = false;
    rb.AddForce(transform.up * vy);
}
```

We only want to move vertical (jump) if we are touching the ground AND the player's input is up. If both of those conditions are true, we will add a vertical force to the Rigidbody.

---

```csharp
void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
```

This method executes whenever the player collides with something. We can check to see if the collision object's tag is "Ground" and enable/disable jumping accordingly.

## Final Code

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool isGrounded;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    // OPTIONAL: include if you want to limit x velocity
    private float maxVelX = 10;

    public float xSpeed;
    public float jumpStrength;

    void Start()
    {
        isGrounded = false;
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        float xHat = new Vector2(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0).normalized.x;
        float vx = xHat * xSpeed;
        rb.AddForce(transform.right * vx);

        float yHat = new Vector2(0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical")).normalized.y;
        if (isGrounded && yHat == 1) {
            float vy = yHat * jumpStrength;
            isGrounded = false;
            rb.AddForce(transform.up * vy);
        }

        // OPTIONAL: include if you want to limit x velocity
        rb.velocity = new Vector2(Vector2.ClampMagnitude(rb.velocity, maxVelX).x, rb.velocity.y);
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        isGrounded = collision.gameObject.tag == "Ground";
    }
}
```

### Setting Your Public Variables in the Inspector

In the Unity Inspector, you'll see `X Speed` and `Jump Strength` from your public variables in your script. Test out different values unitl you like them. You might also consider adjusting drag and gravity in the Rigidbody.
