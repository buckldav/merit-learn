# Animation

First, create a spritesheet via a website like [piskelapp.com](https://www.piskelapp.com). Export your project as a PNG spritesheet.

<div style="display:flex;gap:12px;">
<span>1.</span>
<img src="/assets/images/unity/animation/export1.png" width="200">
<span>2.</span>
<img src="/assets/images/unity/animation/export2.png" width="200">
</div>

Here's the spritesheet for this character (they are slightly different circles in case you couldn't tell):

Import your spritesheet to your assets. A popular method is dragging the image file from its folder to the asset window of Unity.
