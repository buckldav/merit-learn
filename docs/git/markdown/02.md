# Replit and Markdown

Coders are writers of code and technical documentation. They need to be able to share content and communicate quickly. These tools will help you do that.

- **Replit** is a popular online Integrated Development Environment, where you can write, store, execute, and share programs. Think of it like Google Drive for developers, with some extra CS-specific features.
- **Markdown** is the language for writing documentation and other CS-related content. This page was [written in Markdown](https://github.com/buckldav/merit-learn/tree/master/docs/git/markdown/02.md)!

We will dive into Markdown first, which we will use to provide `README.md` files (containing instructions for usage and descriptions of functionality) to our code projects.

## Markdown

With Markdown, you can format plain text to look like headings, links, images, and more!

<details markdown="block">

This is a paragraph.
