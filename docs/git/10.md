# GitHub Pages with Jekyll

Want to create a site like this one? Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a repository using the `just-the-docs` template

This site was created using [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs). I have made a template version of just-the-docs that is easy to create a new repository from. Just visit [this repository](https://github.com/buckldav/just-the-docs) and select "Use this template."

### 2. Update `config.yml`

This file is where the settings for your Jekyll site are located.

The `baseurl` should match your repository's name and the `url` should have your GitHub username as the subdomain. Once each of the following settings match your repository, your GitHub pages site will be available at [https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>](https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>).

```yaml
title: Site Title
description: Some docs for my class
baseurl: "/<repo-name>" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://<username>.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
```

```yaml
# Aux links for the upper right navigation
aux_links:
  "Site Title on GitHub":
    - "//github.com/<username>/<repo-name>"
```

```yaml
footer_content: 'Copyright &copy; 2022 <Your Name>. Distributed by an <a href="https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>/tree/main/LICENSE.txt">MIT license.</a>'
```

### 3. Change colors and fonts

Visit `_sass/support/_variables.scss`.

#### Fonts

You can use Google Fonts by importing them. Set the `$body-font-family` and `$mono-font-family` variables.

```scss
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inconsolata&family=Kdam+Thmor+Pro&display=swap");
$body-font-family: "Kdam Thmor Pro", sans-serif !default;
$mono-font-family: "Inconsolata", monospace !default;
```

#### Colors

The main colors to change are these:

```scss
$link-color: $blue-000 !default;
$btn-primary-color: $blue-100 !default;
```

If you want to customize the purple, blue, green, yellow, or red color shades, I recommend using `hsl` color values to easily get different luminosities of the same hue. Example:

```scss
$yellow-000: hsl(50, 95%, 75%) !default;
$yellow-100: hsl(50, 95%, 66%) !default;
$yellow-200: hsl(50, 95%, 57%) !default;
$yellow-300: hsl(50, 95%, 48%) !default;
```

### 4. Add content

`index.md` is the home page of your site. Visit the `docs` folder to add and modify Markdown files. See the included example files for more.

### 5. Local development

Clone your repository. Ensure you have Ruby installed by running `ruby -v` in a terminal (if not, [download Ruby here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)). Then, run `jekyll serve` to server your files.
